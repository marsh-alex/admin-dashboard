## Overview: 
this is a mockup design layout for a administrative dashboard (CRM, Jive etc). The purpose of this project was to help me learn how to create layouts using CSS Grid. Up until this point I had mostly been using Flexbox for layouts so I'm thrilled to learn how to use grid to create modular layouts like this one. 

## Features:
- Responsive web design to a range of different viewport sizes
- Utilized auto-fit and minmax in CSS to allow the project section to resize and fill with project tiles accordingly
- Used the Hover psuedo class to create some responsiveness when navigating the various links on the page

## Tools:
- VS Code
- GitHub
- Git
- iterm2 Terminal
- Google dev tools

## Outcome:
- Learned how to make responsive web designs with Grid
- learned how to use minmax and autofit
- Deepened capabilities with Google Dev tools to structure layouts

## Languages:
- HTML
- CSS
